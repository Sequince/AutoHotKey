# AutoHotKey
AutoHotKey is a windows based scripting language that allows an advanced user to develop scripts that perform anything a human user can do via automation.
- Screen recognition
- Sounds/GUI Interfaces / interaction with screen/system
- Advanced scripts allow for system manipulation, altering program properties and essentially anything a user can desire, can be developed with enough time.

This is basically a copy of my at home script, all code was developed over the years by me.
My script gives a great deal of quality of life improvements when using a PC.
